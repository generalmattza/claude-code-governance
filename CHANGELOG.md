# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/) with a security-tightening carve-out (see SECURITY.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **2026-04-29 14:42** Redacted real prospect / client names from all public docs. Replaced specific organization names with anonymized candidate profiles (regulated municipal / law-enforcement Windows-heavy; regulated forensics / public-safety mixed-fleet; federally-regulated Mac-heavy research org). Specific candidate names are now tracked privately by the maintainer. Affected: `docs/pilot-validation.md`, `docs/v1.0.0-readiness.md`, `docs/external-security-review-rfp.md`, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-29-phase1-plan10-pilot-validation.md`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-plan10-pilot-validation.md`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-claude-code-security-repo-design.md`, and the prior `[0.9.0-rc.2]` Added entry.
- **2026-04-30 10:08** OSS-framing pass: pilot runbook, pilot agreement template, pilot final-report signature line, RFP intro and submission line, and v1.0.0-readiness pilot definition rephrased so external adopters can run them, not only BITSUMMIT-led pilots. Added `docs/superpowers/README.md` marking that directory as the maintainer's build journal (kept for transparency, not load-bearing for adoption). Affected: `docs/pilot-validation.md`, `docs/v1.0.0-readiness.md`, `docs/pilot-templates/agreement.md`, `docs/pilot-templates/final-report.md`, `docs/external-security-review-rfp.md`, `docs/superpowers/README.md` (new).
- **2026-04-30 10:21** Repo-rename followups: replaced four lingering `cd claude-code-security` lines with `cd claude-code-governance` to match the renamed GitHub repo. Genericized `docs/superpowers/` planning artifacts to remove BITSUMMIT-internal voice and personal home-directory paths; technical/architectural content preserved. Remaining BITSUMMIT mentions in that directory are limited to locked branding (plugin name, publisher, LICENSE copyright). Affected: `README.md`, `docs/deployment/mdm-jamf.md`, `installers/linux/README.md`, `installers/windows/README.md`, and 13 files under `docs/superpowers/plans/` and `docs/superpowers/specs/`.

## [0.9.0-rc.2] - 2026-04-29

This is a **release candidate**. Plans 1-9 of 10 are shipped; Plan 10 (pilot validation) is user-action and gates `v1.0.0`.

### Added
- `docs/pilot-validation.md`: canonical pilot runbook covering candidate-client profiles (specific names tracked privately by the maintainer), pilot criteria, four-phase rollout (kickoff / rollout / hardening / signoff), v1.0.0 readiness checklist, friction-log template inline, and internal incident drill template inline.
- `docs/external-security-review-rfp.md`: Request-for-Proposal template the maintainer sends to security firms (Trail of Bits, NCC Group, Doyensec, Cure53, Atredis, Include Security). Includes scope (in / out), deliverables, timeline, budget guidance, and a 10-question engagement Q&A template.
- `docs/pilot-templates/agreement.md`: pilot agreement template with explicit `[FILL]` markers and counsel-disclaimer.
- `docs/pilot-templates/friction-log.md`: running friction-log template with severity definitions (P0 / P1 / P2), status values, weekly check-in summaries, and v1.0.0 aggregate gating logic.
- `docs/pilot-templates/incident-drill.md`: five-drill simulated bypass-attempt template (T-001 secret leak, T-005 destructive FS, T-007 egress, T-008 pipe-to-shell, T-014 MDM bypass) with pass criteria and post-drill checklist.
- `docs/pilot-templates/final-report.md`: pilot signoff template with phase completion table, friction summary, drill results, audit log integrity attestation, recommendations to maintainer, and signature block.
- `docs/v1.0.0-readiness.md`: single-page summary of remaining user-action items before `v1.0.0`. Lists required items (pilot signoff, security review, PGP key, npm token, Apple cert, CHANGELOG entry, plugin marketplace listing) and optional items (Windows EV cert, OpenSSF Scorecard, public case study).
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-plan10-pilot-validation.md` and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-29-phase1-plan10-pilot-validation.md`.

### Changed
- `README.md`: status banner updated to reflect Plans 1-9 shipped and Plan 10 as user-action; added "v1.0.0 path" section near the top linking the three pilot / review / readiness docs; version badge bumped to `0.9.0-rc.2`; OpenSSF Scorecard placeholder updated to "pending v1.0.0".

### Notes
- 313 tests passing (unchanged from `v0.9.0-rc.1`; Plan 10 ships docs only, not code).
- `v1.0.0` is **not** tagged in this release. `v1.0.0` is the maintainer's call after pilot signoff and external security review report are filed.
- Plan 10 is the final plan in Phase 1 of the project. All Plan 1-9 deliverables are shipped; the project is feature-complete and infrastructure-complete.

## [0.9.0-rc.1] - 2026-04-29

This is a **release candidate**. Only Plan 10 (pilot validation) remains before `v1.0.0`.

This release ships the release-engineering substrate: SBOM, GHSA pipeline scaffolding, Node SEA binary build templates, provenance, and the canonical release runbook. Actual signature production (PGP, Apple Developer ID, Authenticode) is gated on maintainer-provisioned secrets and is wired as drop-in steps in `docs/release-engineering.md`.

### Added
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` job `publish` now runs `npx @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm@2` after the npm publish step and attaches `sbom.cyclonedx.json` as a release asset.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` job `sea-build`: matrix build (`macos-14`, `macos-13`, `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`) producing Node Single-Executable Application binaries `ccsec-{macos-arm64, macos-x64, linux-x64, windows-x64}` via `scripts/build-sea.sh` (esbuild bundle, SEA blob, postject inject).
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` job `release-manifest`: downloads SEA artifacts, generates `SHA256SUMS`, attaches binaries + manifest to the GitHub release. PGP-signing the manifest is wired as a documented future step in `docs/release-engineering.md` and a TODO comment in the workflow.
- `scripts/build-sea.sh`: cross-platform SEA build script (macOS arm64/x64, Linux x64, Windows x64) using `esbuild@0.20` for bundling and `postject@1` for blob injection. Auto-detects target if not supplied; handles macOS codesign-removal pre-postject.
- `docs/release-engineering.md`: canonical release runbook covering pre-release gates, version + tag, the three CI jobs, signing slots (PGP, Apple Developer ID + notarize, Windows Authenticode), the secrets the maintainer must provision, post-release verification, the security-advisory pipeline (GHSA private fork -> coordinated disclosure -> publish), and backports across `release/v1.x`.
- `.github/security-advisory-template.md`: template for new GitHub Security Advisories. Reporter sections + maintainer sections clearly delineated; includes CVSS 4.0 placeholder, threat ID linkage to `docs/threat-model.md`, and disclosure-timeline grid.
- `.github/SECURITY.yml`: minimal GHSA configuration pointing at `SECURITY.md` and the advisory template, with `bit-haseebminhas` as default reviewer.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-plan9-release-engineering.md` and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-29-phase1-plan9-release-engineering.md`.

### Changed
- `SECURITY.md`: added explicit Disclosure Timeline section (ack 72h, fix-or-roadmap HIGH 14d / MEDIUM 30d, default 90-day disclosure window, CRITICAL collapse-to-fastest); added GHSA URL as preferred reporting channel; added Hall of Thanks placeholder section; added PGP Key placeholder section pointing at the runbook for generation procedure; expanded scope statement to enumerate shipped binaries; clarified the SemVer security carve-out.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` `permissions.contents` raised from `read` to `write` so `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` can attach assets.

### Notes
- 313 tests passing; coverage above 90 percent. No new tests (Plan 9 ships CI infrastructure, not new hook code).
- Actual signature production requires maintainer-provisioned secrets: `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GPG_PASSPHRASE`, `APPLE_CERT_P12`, `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `WINDOWS_CERT_PFX`, `WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD`. The runbook documents how to provision each.
- `npm publish --provenance` was already wired in Plan 6 (`v0.6.0-beta.0`); SLSA Level 3 attestation is automatic when `id-token: write` is set, which it is.
- Plan 10 (pilot validation) is the final step before `v1.0.0`.

## [0.8.0-rc.0] - 2026-04-29

This is a **release candidate**. Only Plan 9 (release engineering: signed releases, SBOM, GHSA workflow, OpenSSF Scorecard) and Plan 10 (pilot validation) remain before `v1.0.0`.

### Added
- `scripts/gen-hook-docs.mjs` and `scripts/gen-coverage-matrix.mjs`: Node ESM auto-generators that walk `packages/hooks/src/*/index.ts`, dynamically import each compiled hook from `dist/`, read its manifest, and emit `docs/hooks/<name>.md` (one page per hook, 26 total) and `docs/coverage-matrix.md` (threat-to-hook map plus per-event tables and summary stats).
- `pnpm gen:hook-docs`, `pnpm gen:coverage-matrix`, `pnpm gen:docs` workspace scripts.
- `docs/hooks/<name>.md` for all 26 hooks: manifest table (event, matchers, threat, profiles, severity, timeout), threat link to `docs/threat-model.md`, behavior + notes blocks (sourced from `// DOC:` and `// NOTES:` comment blocks in the hook source or left as TODO for hand-curation).
- `docs/known-bypasses.md`: documented detection gaps with vector / detection status / recommended response. Eight bypasses covered: `disableAllHooks` (issue #26637), cross-process audit log fork, bash escape-handling in `maskQuotedRegions`, heredoc bodies, pipe-to-interpreter, obfuscated git via aliases, filesystem hardlinks / bind mounts, and `bash <<<$(curl)` combo.
- `docs/adr/0005-rules-package-decision.md`: why `@bitsummit/ccsec-rules` ships markdown templates rather than executable rule code.
- `docs/adr/0006-mdm-deployment-decision.md`: why we chose Jamf Configuration Profile + companion script for `managed-settings.json` deployment, and why we ship per-OS path templates rather than auto-detecting.
- `docs/settings-reference.md`: schema-of-record for every settings.json key the project uses, including `schema`, `ccsec_version`, `audit.log_path`, `audit.egress_allowlist`, `audit.verify_on_session_start`, `permissions.deny[].pattern`, `permissions.deny[].threat`, `permissions.allow[]`, `hooks.<event>[].name`, plus the path-token table per OS.
- `installers/windows/README.md`: substantive Intune deployment guide (~150 lines) covering Win32 app packaging, the v1.1 `install-managed.ps1` / `verify-managed.ps1` templates, NTFS ACL hardening, sha256 manifest, and Intune Compliance scheduling. Templates pending v1.1.
- `installers/linux/README.md`: substantive Linux deployment guide (~150 lines) covering shell installer template, Ansible role template, `.deb` / `.rpm` packaging, `chattr +i` immutability, sha256 manifest, and systemd timer / cron scheduling. Templates pending v1.2.

### Changed
- `README.md`: moved from "Plan 7 of 10" to "Plan 8 of 10"; added release-candidate banner; added badges (MIT license, version, hook count, threat coverage, OpenSSF Scorecard placeholder); added Table of Contents linking Track 1-5 sections; added "What's protected / What's not" honesty box.
- `docs/coverage-matrix.md`: replaced the hand-maintained Plan 1-5 version with the auto-generated artifact from `gen-coverage-matrix.mjs`. The new matrix groups by threat ID, includes per-event tables, and emits summary stats (26 hooks, 14 distinct threats, 4 events).
- Stub READMEs at `installers/windows/README.md` and `installers/linux/README.md` replaced with full deployment guides.

### Notes
- 313 tests passing; coverage above 90 percent.
- The `// DOC:` / `// NOTES:` source-comment convention is established but not yet populated; per-hook hand-curation is a follow-up. Each generated page falls back to a TODO line when the comments are absent, and the auto-generator's footer makes the regeneration command discoverable.
- Plan 9 (release engineering) will add CI gates that fail on doc drift, sign release artifacts, emit SBOM, and stand up the GHSA + OpenSSF Scorecard workflow.
- Plan 10 (pilot validation) is the final step before `v1.0.0`.

## [0.7.0-beta.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- `installers/macos/jamf/com.bitsummit.claude-code-security.mobileconfig.xml`: Jamf Configuration Profile template (Custom Settings payload) for fleet deployment of `managed-settings.json`.
- `installers/macos/jamf/README.md`: admin workflow for importing the profile, scoping a smart group, populating the base64 payload, and running verification.
- `installers/macos/install-managed.sh`: sudo-only installer that compiles the chosen profile and writes `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` as `root:wheel`, mode `0644`, with `chflags uchg` immutability and a `.ccsec-manifest` recording sha256.
- `installers/macos/verify-managed.sh`: tamper-detection verifier. Re-hashes the deployed file, compares against the manifest, warns if the immutable flag is missing. Exit code 2 on mismatch.
- `docs/deployment/mdm-jamf.md`: end-to-end IT-admin deployment guide covering compile, profile import, scoping, verification, periodic compliance checks, and tamper response.

### Changed
- README install section now references the Jamf profile template + deployment guide as the path for MDM admins.

### Notes
- `install-managed.sh` and `verify-managed.sh` require sudo and the `/Library/Application Support` system path; they are intentionally NOT exercised by the bats suite (which runs unprivileged). The bats suite continues to cover the per-user installer (`install.sh` + `verify.sh`).
- Intune / Workspace ONE / Kandji equivalents are out of scope; tracked for a future plan.
- Signed releases / SBOM / GHSA workflow still tracked for Plan 9.

## [0.6.0-beta.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- `packages/plugin/` Claude Code plugin manifest with `/ccsec` slash command (marketplace listing: BITSUMMIT Hardening).
- `packages/meta/` umbrella package `@bitsummit/claude-code-security` aggregating all sub-packages.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishing all packages to npm on tag push (skipped if NPM_TOKEN absent).
- README install instructions for all 3 distribution channels + profile chooser table.

### Changed
- `ccsec apply` gains `--force` flag (override user-modification guard).
- `ccsec apply` gains `--rules` flag (install CLAUDE.md template from `@bitsummit/ccsec-rules` for the chosen profile if no CLAUDE.md exists).
- `ccsec apply` gains `--no-rules` flag (explicit opt-out, since some users may have pre-existing CLAUDE.md they want to preserve unchanged).

### Notes
- Actual npm publish requires NPM_TOKEN repository secret; the workflow tolerates absence and the user provisions on their schedule.
- Plugin marketplace listing submission is an Anthropic-side action, not in scope for this plan.
- Jamf / managed-settings.json deployment still tracked for Plan 7.

## [0.5.0-beta.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- 8 new hooks: `behavioral-rule-enforcer`, `claude-md-validator`, `untrusted-content-tagger`, `disable-all-hooks-detector`, `local-settings-precedence-checker`, `subagent-spawn-guard`, `task-tool-input-guard`, `agent-allowlist-enforcer`. Hook surface complete (26 hooks total).
- New `@bitsummit/ccsec-rules` package with CLAUDE.md hardening templates per profile (baseline, strict, regulated) plus reusable snippets (no-eval, no-curl-pipe-shell, no-force-push).
- New overlays: `overlays/behavioral.json`, `overlays/mdm-bypass.json`, `overlays/agent-gating.json`.
- Integration transcripts: behavioral-bypass-attempt, mdm-bypass-attempt, subagent-escape-attempt, regulated-profile-end-to-end.
- Threat model entries: T-010 Prompt Injection from Tool Output, T-011 Subagent Escape, T-012 MDM Bypass via disableAllHooks (passive per ADR-0003), T-013 Local Settings Overriding Managed.

### Changed
- **Strict and regulated profiles now differentiated for real** (Plans 1-4 shipped them as identical-content shells). Strict adds tighter egress allowlist (4 hosts) plus the agent-gating overlay; regulated adds the tightest egress (2 hosts) plus the mdm-bypass overlay.
- Settings compiler deep-merges top-level objects from extends fragments and applies sub-key overrides from `profile.overrides`. This lets `audit.log_path` (base) and `audit.egress_allowlist` (network-egress overlay) and `audit.verify_on_session_start` (audit overlay) coexist, while strict/regulated tighten only `egress_allowlist`.
- Threat ID cleanup: `submodule-injection-guard` renamed to `T-018-supply-chain-submodule` (was `T-005` in Plan 3, then `T-013` in Plan 4). T-013 is now reserved for local settings precedence.
- Project version moves from `alpha` to `beta`. Hook surface is feature-complete; remaining plans are distribution (Plan 6), Jamf integration (Plan 7), full docs (Plan 8), release engineering (Plan 9), pilot validation (Plan 10).

### Notes
- Plugin / npm distribution still tracked for Plan 6.
- Jamf / managed-settings.json deployment still tracked for Plan 7.
- Signed releases / SBOM / GHSA workflow still tracked for Plan 9 (T-018 distribution-side coverage).

## [0.4.0-alpha.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- 4 new hooks: `webfetch-egress-guard`, `bash-egress-guard`, `audit-tamper-detector`, `audit-session-summary`.
- New overlays: `overlays/network-egress.json` and `overlays/audit.json`.
- Integration transcripts: webfetch-exfil-attempt, bash-egress-attempt, audit-tamper-attempt.
- Threat model entries: T-005 fully covered, T-014 Tool Spoofing via MCP (partial), T-015 Audit Log Tampering, T-016 Hook DoS, T-017 Repudiation of Risky Action.

### Changed
- `AuditLogger.write()` serializes concurrent in-process writes via internal promise queue; closes the race noted in Plan 1 review.
- `AuditLogger.verify()` returns `{ ok: true, records: 0 }` on missing file (was throwing) and `{ ok: false, brokenAt: i }` on JSON-parse failure (was throwing).
- All 3 profiles extend the network-egress and audit overlays.

### Notes
- Cross-process audit log safety still tracked for a future plan (per-PID files or flock).
- Strict / regulated profile differentiation still tracked for Plan 5.
- Plugin / npm distribution still tracked for Plan 6.

## [0.3.0-alpha.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- 6 new hooks: `bash-structural-guard`, `pipe-to-shell-guard`, `branch-protection-guard`, `commit-amend-pushed-guard`, `submodule-injection-guard`, `git-history-rewrite-guard`.
- New overlays: `overlays/bash-structural.json` and `overlays/branch-guards.json`.
- `fast-check` property-based fuzz test for `bash-parser`.
- Integration transcripts: bash-structural-attempt, branch-sabotage-attempt, history-rewrite-attempt.
- Threat model entries: T-005 Supply Chain via Submodule, T-006 Pipe-to-Shell Remote Execution, T-007 Command Chaining Bypass, T-008 Git History Rewrite, T-009 Arbitrary Code via eval/command substitution.

### Changed
- Bash parser detects fullwidth pipe (U+FF5C) and fullwidth dollar (U+FF04) as unicode lookalikes.
- Bash parser detects `&` (background operator) as a new structural risk kind.
- T-004 marked fully covered (was partial in Plan 2).
- All 3 profiles extend the new overlays.

### Notes
- Audit-logger concurrency hardening still tracked for Plan 4.
- Egress / WebFetch allowlist still tracked for Plan 4.
- Strict / regulated profile differentiation still tracked for Plan 5.

## [0.2.0-alpha.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- 7 new hooks: `secret-leak-detector` (PostToolUse), `keychain-guard`, `mcp-secret-guard`, `destructive-fs-guard`, `git-destructive-guard`, `sensitive-paths-guard`, `dotfile-guard`.
- `packages/settings/overlays/destructive.json` and `packages/settings/overlays/sensitive-paths.json`.
- `packages/settings/profiles/strict.json` and `packages/settings/profiles/regulated.json` (shells; Plan 5 differentiates).
- Compiled snapshots for strict and regulated profiles.
- 4 new integration transcripts: secret-leak-postonly, destructive-attempt, sensitive-paths-attempt, attack-chain.
- Threat model entries for T-002, T-003, T-004; T-001 expanded with PostToolUse + MCP + keychain coverage.
- `docs/coverage-matrix.md` mapping every hook to threats and profiles.
- ADR-0004 documenting hook contract bumps.

### Changed
- `HookManifest.severity` accepts `HookSeverity` scalar OR `Record<HookProfile, HookSeverity>` per-profile record (additive, backward compatible).
- `HookManifest.matchers` accepts `*` (any tool) and `<prefix>*` patterns.
- `HookContext` gains optional `response` field for PostToolUse hooks.
- Runner resolves per-profile severity and modulates hook decisions accordingly.
- `baseline` profile now extends three overlays (was one in Plan 1).

### Notes
- Audit-logger concurrency hardening still tracked for Plan 4.
- Egress / WebFetch allowlist still tracked for Plan 4 (attack-chain transcript flags step 2 as partial-block).
- Strict / regulated profile differentiation still tracked for Plan 5.

## [0.1.0-alpha.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- pnpm-workspace monorepo with TypeScript, vitest, ESLint, Prettier baseline.
- `packages/core/` runtime: hook contract types, manifest validator (zod), path-token resolver (HOME/SSH/AWS/TMP/KEYS), secret pattern library (AWS/GitHub/Stripe/PEM/Slack/Google), structural-bash parser (chaining/substitution/pipe-to-shell/unicode-lookalikes), JSONL audit logger with sha256 hash chain, hook runner with profile/matcher gating and timeout enforcement.
- `packages/hooks/secret-guard` canary hook (PreToolUse, severity=block) blocking secret literals and env-dump patterns.
- `packages/settings/` with base config, secrets overlay, baseline profile, compiled snapshot.
- `packages/cli/` with `ccsec compile | apply | doctor` commands and Commander entry point.
- `installers/macos/` with `install.sh`, `verify.sh`, and bats integration tests.
- `installers/windows/` and `installers/linux/` placeholder READMEs (planned for v1.1 / v1.2).
- Initial threat model documenting T-001 (Secret Leak via Tool Output).
- Three architecture decision records: ADR-0001 Node.js hooks, ADR-0002 monorepo layout, ADR-0003 passive-only enforcement posture.
- `SECURITY.md` disclosure policy.
- `tests/integration/` with synthetic transcript replay through runner+secret-guard.
- GitHub Actions CI workflow on `macos-14` running lint, typecheck, build, vitest with coverage gates, and bats.

### Fixed
- `secret-guard` regex now blocks bare `env` and `printenv` (full environment dump); earlier draft required trailing arguments.
- CLI `--settings-root` Commander option now applies the default value correctly (third-arg signature was previously the description).
- Root `build:settings` script now invokes `bin/ccsec.js` (the entry that calls `main()`) instead of `dist/index.js` (which only exports `main`).

### Notes
- Audit-logger walking-skeleton has no in-process write serialization or cross-process locking. Concurrent writers may fork the chain. Hardening tracked for Plan 4 (audit overlay).
